## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid yellow-green (#A7D14B), echoing freshness and sustainability; avoid literal 'green' and aim for an organic but clear hue.
- Background color: Pale light-green (#F4F9EC), nearly desaturated, providing a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft lime (#D5E889) to highlight calls to action, analogous to the primary color, contrasting in brightness to create emphasis.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will be used to maintain a modern look and also be approachable and friendly to new users.
- Use a set of clean, modern, outline-style icons that visually represent waste types, actions (like 'classify', 'log', 'sell'), and categories.
- Employ a minimal design, leveraging white space, with a grid-based layout. All screen should use a one-column layout for simplicity.
- Introduce subtle animations on button presses, loading states, and transitions between the onboarding cards and the main screens.
